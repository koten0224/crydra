# Crydra

Crydra is an upcoming web framework for [Crystal language](https://crystal-lang.org), inspired by the philosophy and productivity of Ruby on Rails.

> ⚠️ **Status: Experimental**  
> This is a placeholder repository for future development. Naming and vision are claimed — implementation is under active planning.

## Vision

- **Rails-like developer experience**: Convention over configuration, scaffold generators, helpers, and rich ecosystem.
- **Crystal performance**: Compiled language, native speed, concurrency built-in.
- **Modular architecture**: Pluggable ORM, routers, serializers — you choose your stack.

## Early Goals

- ✅ Register the `crydra` shard name
- 🛠️ Build core routing and controller layers
- 📦 Provide JSON API mode first (inspired by Rails API-only mode)
- 🧪 Include built-in spec support
- 🔧 CLI generator for scaffolds and migrations (planned)

## Who is this for?

- Crystal developers looking for a batteries-included framework
- Rubyists curious about Crystal but missing Rails' structure
- Contributors who want to help shape the next-gen framework

## Roadmap

- [ ] Routing DSL
- [ ] Basic Controller & Action system
- [ ] Request/Response abstraction
- [ ] JSON serialization
- [ ] ORM abstraction layer (not tied to a specific DB)
- [ ] Generator CLI (e.g., `crydra new`, `crydra generate model`)
